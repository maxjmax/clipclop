## Status

Beta. I use it, but there's probably a few issues remaining.

## Installation

- Go build
- Run clipclop as a user service / in .xinitrc / other
- Use the provided `clip.sh` or something similar to communicate with the daemon and pipe the strings to dmenu (or equivalent).

## Usage

`clipclop -h`
